# Memory game
This game was developed during the front-end web development nanodegree of Udacity. It is a final project 
to complete the nanodegree program. And, it works with the most current technologies.

## Used Technologies
### Git Bash
[System control version.](https://git-scm.com/)

### BootStrap v. 4.1.3
The game was developed with the BootStrap framework, **version 4.1.3**.

### JavaScript
During the development process of this project was used Object-oriented JavaScript. In addition, its documentation was consulted on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) platform (MDN).

### JQuery
[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a fantastic library. It was also used in this project: selecting elements, calling modals and  delegating events.

### CSS3
Cascade Style Sheet (CSS).

### HTML5
Hypertext Markup language (HTML).

## Logic of the game
**index.html** is the main file of the game. This happens, because **index.html** an Graphical User Interface (GUI); 
very important for the player.

Click on **index.html** file twice. When the web page loads, a modal appears immediately.

* Press **Star game!** button;

At this moment, the timer runs, your stars on the star rating are in risks and the move counter is prepared to you.

* Click on any card;

The clicked card shows its content. And the game keep it.

* Click on another card;

At this moment, the game check the cards.

The game does not allow clicking on the same clicked or the corresponding card. So, if you do this, nothing will should 
happen anymore.

* If the clicked cards are the same:

You play a game; Go ahead! The cards leave the game. No clicked effect was show anymore.

* If the clicked cards are not the same:

They will should return to the starting position

* If you combine all cards: You win the game! Congratulations!!!

You can restart the game at any moment. When you restart it, the timer, star rating and move counter come back to initial state.

## Explanation note
I'm a git starter professional. So:

* Because of the project is not big;
* Because the time;
* And, because I was working alone;

I did the project and after that, following the construction logic that I used, I split the project in small portions 
and made the commit on the git.

Now, because of Udacity's Nanodegree, I know how to work with git. And, certainly, working as a group or alone, I will 
use git and become a better professional than today.

The reason for this explanation note is very simple: the time between each commit is very short (especially for a programmer).
Thank you for understanding.

## Note
The note above is about this project before Udacity's review. After the review, I worked in the project using the technologies 
described above and, of course, Git.
